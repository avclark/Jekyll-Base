  <h1>Hurricane Neddy</h1>
  <p>Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three &#8220;Highlander&#8221; movies. Oh, I&#8217;m in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don&#8217;t have to listen to myself. I&#8217;m drunk. We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.</p>

<p>Hi. I&#8217;m Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as &#8220;Smoke Yourself Thin&#8221; and &#8220;Get Some Confidence, Stupid!&#8221; Fire can be our friend; whether it&#8217;s toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie. They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day.</p>

<li>Oh, I&#8217;m in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don&#8217;t have to listen to myself. I&#8217;m drunk.</li>

<li>Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs.</li>

<li>I prefer a vehicle that doesn&#8217;t hurt Mother Earth. It&#8217;s a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction.</li>

<li>And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.</li>
</ul>

<p>A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. Stan Lee never left. I&#8217;m afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There&#8217;s a <em>New</em> Mexico? I was saying &#8220;Boo-urns.&#8221; Well, he&#8217;s kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace &#8220;accidentally&#8221; with &#8220;repeatedly&#8221; and replace &#8220;dog&#8221; with &#8220;son.&#8221; Please do not offer my god a peanut.</p>

<p>Beer. Now there&#8217;s a temporary solution. Marge, just about everything&#8217;s a sin. Y&#8217;ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we&#8217;re not supposed to go to the bathroom. You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don&#8217;t work out in real life, uh, Christianity. A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner.</p>

<li>This is the greatest case of false advertising I&#8217;ve seen since I sued the movie &#8220;The Never Ending Story.&#8221;</li>

<li>I can&#8217;t go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency.</li>

<p>The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… Ahoy hoy? Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing. Old people don&#8217;t need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.</p>
