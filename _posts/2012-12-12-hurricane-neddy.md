Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies. Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk. We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.

## A Streetcar Named Marge
Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!" Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie. They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day.

- Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk.
- Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs.
- I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction.
- And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.

## Homer the Great
A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner. Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. Whoa, slow down there, maestro. There's a *New* Mexico? I was saying "Boo-urns." Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son." Please do not offer my god a peanut.

### Radioactive Man
Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom. You know, the one with all the well meaning rules that don't work out in real life, uh, Christianity. A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner.

1. This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story."
2. I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency.

#### Bart the Daredevil
The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… Ahoy hoy? Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing. Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use.
